Welcome to the OWASP Rio de Janeiro Chapter home page.

We will share the schedule of our events on this page in April 2021, where we will offer free lectures and workshops with great security-related experts and great networking.

## Participation

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a not-for-profit, worldwide organization focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license.
